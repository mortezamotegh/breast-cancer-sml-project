# Breast Cancer SML Project

This project is part of my Statistical Machine Learning coursework.  
It analyzes **breast cancer diagnosis** using features extracted from cell nuclei in fine needle aspiration (FNA) images of breast masses.

The repository contains:
- **`report.html`** â€“ A redacted HTML report (first 5 lines of code shown, full code available in `src/`).
- **`src/`** â€“ Source code for data processing, analysis, and model building.
- **Dataset description** â€“ See below for feature explanations.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

Each row in the dataset represents a breast mass sample, with features computed from the FNA image of the cell nuclei.

### Features

1. **Radius** â€“ Average distance between the nucleus center and its perimeter points. Larger radius may indicate malignancy.
2. **Texture** â€“ Standard deviation of gray-scale values. Higher variation can signal irregular texture.
3. **Perimeter** â€“ Total length around the nucleus.
4. **Area** â€“ Total area of the nucleus. Malignant nuclei often have larger areas.
5. **Smoothness** â€“ Local variation in radius lengths. Less smoothness means more irregularity.
6. **Compactness** â€“ `(perimeterÂ² / area) â€“ 1`. Measures how compact the nucleus is.
7. **Concavity** â€“ Severity of concave portions of the contour.
8. **Concave Points** â€“ Number of concave points along the contour.
9. **Symmetry** â€“ How symmetrical the nucleus is. Asymmetry can indicate malignancy.
10. **Fractal Dimension** â€“ Complexity of the nucleus boundary.

For each feature, the dataset includes:
- **Mean** â€“ Average over all measured nuclei in the sample.
- **Standard Error** â€“ Variation across nuclei.
- **Worst (largest)** â€“ Average of the three largest values, emphasizing extremes.
