# Breast Cancer SML Project

This project is part of my Statistical Machine Learning coursework.  
It analyzes **breast cancer diagnosis** using features extracted from cell nuclei in fine needle aspiration (FNA) images of breast masses.

The repository contains:
- **`report.html`** â€“ A redacted HTML report where the code chunks show placeholders instead of full implementation; figures and outputs are not included.
- **`script`** â€“ Source code folder with function signatures and structure only; full code available upon request.
- **Dataset description** â€“ See below for feature explanations
- **Languages Used**

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a medical procedure healthcare providers use to collect cell samples from a suspicious lump or abnormal area of the body.  
Itâ€™s also called a *fine-needle biopsy*.  
FNA involves extracting cells, tissue, and sometimes fluids using a thin needle and syringe.  
The collected sample is then prepared and analyzed â€” in this case, **microscopic images of the extracted cells are processed to calculate diagnostic features**.

The dataset contains measurements from **fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** images of breast mass cell nuclei.  
It is widely used in machine learning research to develop models that can distinguish between **benign** (non-cancerous) and **malignant** (cancerous) tumors.  

The dataset includes **569 samples**, each described by **30 numeric features** derived from 10 original cell nucleus characteristics.  
These features are designed to capture size, shape, texture, and complexity of the cell nuclei â€” all of which can be indicators of malignancy.



### Features

1. **Radius** â€“ Average distance between the nucleus center and its perimeter points. Larger radius may indicate malignancy.
2. **Texture** â€“ Standard deviation of gray-scale values. Higher variation can signal irregular texture.
3. **Perimeter** â€“ Total length around the nucleus.
4. **Area** â€“ Total area of the nucleus. Malignant nuclei often have larger areas.
5. **Smoothness** â€“ Local variation in radius lengths. Less smoothness means more irregularity.
6. **Compactness** â€“ `(perimeterÂ² / area) â€“ 1`. Measures how compact the nucleus is.
7. **Concavity** â€“ Severity of concave portions of the contour.
8. **Concave Points** â€“ Number of concave points along the contour.
9. **Symmetry** â€“ How symmetrical the nucleus is. Asymmetry can indicate malignancy.
10. **Fractal Dimension** â€“ Complexity of the nucleus boundary.

For each feature, the dataset includes:
- **Mean** â€“ Average over all measured nuclei in the sample.
- **Standard Error** â€“ Variation across nuclei.
- **Worst (largest)** â€“ Average of the three largest values, emphasizing extremes.
